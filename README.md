Reading notes of paper : [MMD GAN: Towards Deeper Understanding of Moment Matching Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08584)

To train generator g_theta and discriminator f_phi. f has to be injective, therefore, we use an autoencoder. g can be achieved with feed forward network thus encoder. 

Gradient has to be bounded: clipping or gradient penalty

In this paper they used different kernels
